            <h2>Latest Sneaker Releases</h2>
            <p>The Nike Zoom Vomero 5 “University Red” Releases On December 13th
                Following not long after the appearance of its “University Blue” colorway, the Nike Zoom Vomero 5 is now going all-in on an equally popular staple of the Swoosh: “University Red.”

Unlike its above-mentioned counterpart, which made little use of the Tar Heels signature, this Nike Zoom Vomero 5 dresses itself almost entirely in “University Red.” The latter is used along everything from the leather paneling to the suede trims and cage, while similar, albeit slightly more desaturated shades dress the accents adjacent. Neutrals, then, help round out the package: alongside a light grey Swoosh and silver reflective detailing, the pair applies touches of white to its midsole, branding, and open knit mesh.

Enjoy a closer look at the Nike Zoom Vomero 5 “University Red” via the official images ahead. These should be available soon at Nike.com and select retailers.

In other news, official images of the Nike Air Max CB 94 Mocha surfaced earlier this week.

            <h2>Nike’s Air Force 1 Mid Gets A Denim Makeover</h2>
            <p>Receiving a miniature revitalization at the hands of the late Virgil Abloh and Off-White’s past collaborative installments, the Nike Air Force 1 Mid has taken the opportunity to dress in an increased amount of contemporary outfits. Come next year, the mid-top model has plans to execute one of its most audacious designs yet.

                From the vamp to the heel and ankle strap, every single panel across the upper is doused in a deep indigo denim wash. Crafting a clad composition through the textile’s simultaneous inclusion within the tongue, delicate cream stitching complements the tonal paneling, reminiscing on the tooling of a hardy pair of blue jeans. What’s more, the midsole and tread underfoot are cast in a striking “Sail” contrast while subtle lilac hues accent the dominant fabric along the laces, insoles and inner lining.
                
                The women’s exclusive Nike Air Force 1 Mid “Denim” is currently expected to release in early 2024 for a retail price of $125. In the meantime, the pair can be seen in detailed imagery ahead.
                
                In other news from the Beaverton brand, the Jordan 3 “Midnight Navy” recently surfaced in official retail</p>

                <h2>Timothée Chalamet’s “Wonka” Nike Dunk Is His Real-Life Golden Ticket</h2>
                <p>Ahead of Wonka‘s debut on December 15th, Timothee Chalamet visited a sort of “Willy Wonka” factory: Nike’s Beaverton, Ore. headquarters. The reason?: To design a Nike Dunk Low inspired by his latest role.

                    In an exclusive interview with Complex, the 27-year-old actor shared his disbelief with the opportunity: “I definitely never thought I would get to be able to say that I got to design a Nike shoe, let alone a Dunk.”
                    
                    At quick glance, the shoe stands out from the sea of Nike Dunks that has taken over the footwear space over the last four years. Closer inspection reveals just how special the pair is. Not surprising for a shoe that’s limited to just five pairs. The “Wonka” Dunks arrive in a simple, but robust wooden box. Inside, a velvet shoe bag branded with a fancy “W” houses the sneakers. A playful pattern takes over the majority of the project’s upper, boasting a combination of purple, burgundy, and blue tones. The print has been seemingly “applied” via crayon, and contrasts the much more refined and ornate profile swooshes, Laces, tongues, top eyelets, and inner lining follow suit, making the most overt nod to Wonka’s suit.
                    
                    “It’s unlike any pair of Dunks I’ve ever seen,” Chalamet told Complex. “I just didn’t know how it would come out and they totally nailed it.” According to the interview, Chalamet channeled Nike SB’s iconic “What the Dunk” and the layering on many sacai x Nike projects for the pair.
                    
                    Although the sneaker won’t be widely available, a giveaway will be hosted in promotion of Wonka. Those interested are asked to submit 1-minute videos of their Willy Wonka-inspired work to enter; there will only be five winners. Check out full details of the #WonkaPureImaginationContest here.
                    
                    Enjoy a closer-look at the pair ahead, and shop all available Dunks via nike.com right now.
